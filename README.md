# MAKA
A high-fidelity prototype using Adobe XD for a tablet app aimed at providing a way for high school students to discover design. Project entered into the College + Amazon Design Creative Jam Hackathon.
# Abstract
Because one of our main goals of this challenge was to help 13 to 17 year-olds discover design, we aimed our focus on having an app that would be easy and abundant in beginner-friendly educational resources. We achieved that in an innovative way by coming up with an easy and interesting clickable picture that first eases the user into the basics of design. We have other resources such as an exploration page and a mentor message board, which are incredibly helpful and crucial to a person's beginning learning experience. Once the user is at a higher level of understanding, or when the user knows what kind of designer they want to be, there is an event/program page that can help further their learning experience. We also added profiles to this app so that there is a sense of community, which is helpful for beginners who may feel alone in their journey to learning design. Since this is an educational app for beginners, we purposefully made the app interface very easy to navigate. There are previous and next buttons as well as a menu to see all the topics at once. We made the background and pictures very simple so that the user can focus on the text. Each topic is differentiated by a different color background.
